In this blog post, we are going to create several interesting, interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data that we've explored in the first several weeks of lectures.

### ยง1. Create a Database

First, we are going to create a database with three tables: `temperatures`, `stations`, and `countries`.

Lets import all the possible packages and modules we may need:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # optional, in case we want to plot
```

Now, lets create and connect our database. We'll name it 'Temperature.db'.

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('Temperature.db')
```

After connecting out database, we want to read in our data from our csv files and
insert them into separate tables in 'Temerature.db'. To do this, we will use the pd.read_csv() function.

```python
stations = pd.read_csv("station-metadata.csv")
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
stations.head()
```

Here we are reading in the csv data and converting it to sqlite3 database. We are creating a table called "stations", connecting it with out 'Temperature.db' using 'conn', and if this table already exists, we will replace it.

We will do the same for the countries database:

```python
countries = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4" : "FIPS"}) #removes spaces to avoid future parsing errors
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
countries.head()
```

Because the temperature file that we are going to put in our database is so large, we need to create a function that will prep the data so that we can run it in as quickly and efficiently as possible. We will reset the indices, rename columns, and change the month and temp columns into a format that is more readable:

```python
def prep_df(df):
    """
    Resets the indices, renames the month and temp columns and returns a cleaned df
    """
    df["FIPS"] = df["ID"].str[0:2] #column with country abbreviation
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year", "FIPS"]) #sets indices to ID, year, and country code for easy extraction
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_3"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int) #month changed from string to int
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100 #converts to Celcius in whole numbers
    return(df)
```
Now that we've done that, we can use this function when reading in out 'temps.csv' file.
Since it is so large, we will use the parameter `chunksize` to break the data into chunks and read it in. This way, importing our data wont overload our computer and use up all its memory. We will iterate through a for loop to read in each chunk:

```python
temps_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for temp in temps_iter:
    df = prep_df(temp)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)

df.head()
```

Awesome! Now we should have three tables in our 'Temperature.db' file. Let's check that this is the case by connecting a cursor--which is our way to communicate to our database--to our `conn` and making sure that we do actually have three tables.

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

We do have three tables `stations`, `countries`, and `temperatures`.
Now, let's write a query function that accesses these tables and spits out amalgamated data in a format we want.

### ยง2. Write a Query Function

Now we are going to write a function called `query_climate_database()` which accepts four arguments:

- `country`, a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.
- `year_begin` and `year_end`, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
- `month`, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.

The return value of `query_climate_database()` is a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year. This dataframe will have columns for:

- The station name.
- The latitude of the station.
- The longitude of the station.
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The month in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month. \

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    country: a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned
    year_begin and year_end, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
    month, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.
    returns a pandas df of temp readings for the specified country, in the specified date range,
    in the specified month of the year
    """
    conn = sqlite3.connect('Temperature.db')
    cmd1 = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on T.FIPS = C.FIPS
    WHERE C.name = ? AND T.year >= ? AND T.year <= ? AND T.month = ?
    """
    parameters = (country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd1, conn, params = parameters)
    conn.close()

    return df
```
This function will allow us to look at data from a designated time frame during a specified month in a specified country. Lets look at it.

```python
query_climate_database(country = "India",
                       year_begin = 1980,
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

Awesome! It works.

### ยง3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

Now we want to create visualizations that address the following question:

> How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?

We are going to write a function called `temperature_coefficient_plot()`. This function accepts five explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments.

- `country`, `year_begin`, `year_end`, and `month` should be as in the previous part.
- `min_obs`, the minimum required number of years of data for any given station. Only data for stations with at least `min_obs` years worth of data in the specified month should be plotted; the others should be filtered out. `df.transform()` plus filtering is a good way to achieve this task.
- `**kwargs`, additional keyword arguments passed to `px.scatter_mapbox()`. These can be used to control the colormap used, the mapbox style, etc.

The output of this function should be an interactive geographic scatterplot, constructed using Plotly Express, with a point for each station, such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that station.

After writing out funtion, we will be able to create a plot of estimated yearly increases in temperature during the month of January, in the interval 1980-2020, in India, as follows:

```python
# assumes you have imported necessary packages
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1,
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()
```

{% include india-HW0-example.html %}

Let's get started.
If we want to estimate the yearly increase in temperature for a given station at a given time, we will want to use a Linear Regression model. Let's create a quick function that will take in the Temperature and Year as x and y and produce a LR coefficient for us. We will later add this data in a column in our dataframe.

```python
def coef(data):
    x = data[["Year"]]
    y = data["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```

We want to use our Query function from part one to gather the data needed. Since there is an additional parameter `min_obs`, we want to count how many measures were taken at a particular station in a certian year and filter them out.
To do this, we will group by the station `NAME` and the `Year`, and use the transform function to produce the length, or number of temperature readings for that station during that particular year:

```python
min_ob = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len)
```

Then we will filter out the stations that don't have the minimum number of temperature readings from our dataset:

```python
 df = df[min_ob >= min_obs] #filtering out all countries with less than the minimum number of observations
```

After doing this, we will use the apply function to apply the linear regression coefficient to the dataframe:

```python
data = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
```

We'll reset the index, rename the columns, and round the data of the new `Estimated Annual Increase (C)` column to three decimal places:

```python
data = data.reset_index()
data = data.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Annual Increase (C)"}) #renames column
data["Estimated Annual Increase (C)"] = data["Estimated Annual Increase (C)"].round(3) #rounds decimals in column
```
Since our months are also in numeric format, we will create a dictionary to help with string translation in the future.
```python
monthw = {1: "January", 2:"February", 3: "March", 4: "April", 5: "May", 6: "June", 7: "July", 8: "August", 9: "September", 10: "October", 11: "November", 12: "December"}
   #month dictionary
```
Now, we will create our figure using plotly's px.scatter_mapbox using our updated data, Latitude and Longitude, Station NAME, and code by color:

```python
fig = px.scatter_mapbox(data,
                           lat = "LATITUDE",
                           lon = "LONGITUDE",
                           hover_name = "NAME",
                           hover_data = ["Estimated Annual Increase (C)"],
                           color = "Estimated Annual Increase (C)",
                           title = "Estimates of annual increase in temperature in " + monthw[month] + f" for stations in {country}, years {year_begin} - {year_end}", **kwargs)
    return fig
```

This is what our full function definition looks like:

```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):

    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)

    min_ob = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len)

    df = df[min_ob >= min_obs] #filtering out all countries with less than the minimum number of observations

    data = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef) #applying linear regresison coef to df
    data = data.reset_index()
    data = data.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Annual Increase (C)"}) #renames column
    data["Estimated Annual Increase (C)"] = data["Estimated Annual Increase (C)"].round(3) #rounds decimals in column

    monthw = {1: "January", 2:"February", 3: "March", 4: "April", 5: "May", 6: "June", 7: "July", 8: "August", 9: "September", 10: "October", 11: "November", 12: "December"}
    #month dictionary
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(data,
                           lat = "LATITUDE",
                           lon = "LONGITUDE",
                           hover_name = "NAME",
                           hover_data = ["Estimated Annual Increase (C)"],
                           color = "Estimated Annual Increase (C)",
                           title = "Estimates of annual increase in temperature in " + monthw[month] + f" for stations in {country}, years {year_begin} - {year_end}", **kwargs)
    return fig
```
Let's try it out.

```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1,
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()
```

### ยง4. Temperature Anomalies by country

> How have the frequency of temperature anomalies changed across different countries?

We want to create a visualization that compares three countries and looks at the frequency of temperature anomalies during a certain month each year within a certain time frame. To do this, we want to define a function temp_anom that accepts

- country 1: the first country we want to look at
- country 2: the second country we want to look at
- country 3: the third country we want to look at
- year_begin: the year we want to start looking at
- year_end: the year we want to end at
- month: the specific month we want to look at

We want to define a function that will allow us to detect temperature anomalies by looking at z-score values.
```python
def z_score(x):
    m = np.mean(x)
    s = np.std(x)
    return (x-m)/s
```

Now that we have this, lets define our function:

```python
def temp_anom(country1, country2, country3, year_begin, year_end, month):
    country1 = query_climate_database(country1, year_begin, year_end, month)
    country2 = query_climate_database(country2, year_begin, year_end, month)
    country3 = query_climate_database(country3, year_begin, year_end, month)

    df = pd.concat([country1, country2, country3], keys=[country1, country2, country3],
    names=['Country', 'Index'], ignore_index=True)

    df["Z-Score"] = df.groupby(["NAME", "Month"])["Temp"].transform(z_score)

    anomalies = df[np.abs(df["Z-Score"]) > 2]

    anomalies = anomalies.groupby(["Name", "Year"])["Z-Score"].count()
    anomalies = anomalies.to_frame()
    anomalies = anomalies.sort_index(ascending = True)
    anomalies = anomalies.reset_index()
    anomalies = anomalies.rename(columns = {"Z-Score" : "Temp_Anomalies"})

    monthw = {1: "January", 2:"February", 3: "March", 4: "April", 5: "May", 6: "June", 7: "July", 8: "August", 9: "September", 10: "October", 11: "November", 12: "December"}

    fig = px.line(data_frame = anomalies,
                  x = "Year",
                  y = "Temp_Anomalies",
                  title = "Number of Temperature Anomalies in " + monthw[month] + " between " + str(year_begin) +" and " + str(year_end),
                  width = 1200,
                  height = 800,
                  color = "Name")

    return fig
```
Breaking this down:
1. We extracted data using our query funtion for each country.
2. We concatenated this data in an all-encompassing dataframe so that we have all the info from each country during a given time period:
```python
df = pd.concat([country1, country2, country3], keys=[country1, country2, country3],
names=['Country', 'Index'], ignore_index=True)
```
3. We used our z-score function to create a column in the dataframe that stores z-scores for each occurence:
```python
df["Z-Score"] = df.groupby(["NAME", "Month"])["Temp"].transform(z_score)
```
4. We filtered out the regularities and preserved the anomalies in a dataframe by checking whether absolute values of z was greater than 2:
```python
anomalies = df[np.abs(df["Z-Score"]) > 2]
```
5. We grouped by Name and Year and used the count() function to determine how many anomalies there were for each year, and we cleaned our anomalies dataframe so that it is easier to read by sorting, resetting indices and renaming columns.
```python
anomalies = anomalies.groupby(["Name", "Year"])["Z-Score"].count()
anomalies = anomalies.to_frame()
anomalies = anomalies.sort_index(ascending = True)
anomalies = anomalies.reset_index()
anomalies = anomalies.rename(columns = {"Z-Score" : "Temp_Anomalies"})
```
6. We created a dictionary to supplement the month column of the dataframe to facilitation integer to string translation for our graph title:
```python
monthw = {1: "January", 2:"February", 3: "March", 4: "April", 5: "May", 6: "June", 7: "July", 8: "August", 9: "September", 10: "October", 11: "November", 12: "December"}
```
7. We created a line graph with the anomalies dataframe, with Year on the x-axis and the Number of Temperature anomalies on the y-axis. We defined a title, figure width and height, and corresponding colors.
```python
fig = px.line(data_frame = anomalies,
              x = "Year",
              y = "Temp_Anomalies",
              title = "Number of Temperature Anomalies in " + monthw[month] + " between " + str(year_begin) +" and " + str(year_end),
              width = 1200,
              height = 800,
              color = "Name")
```
Let's try it out:

```python
fig = temp_anom(country1 = "United States", country2 = "India", country3 = "Australia",
                       year_begin = 1990,
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)

fig.show()
