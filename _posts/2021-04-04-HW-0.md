## Let's Construct a Visualization of the Palmer Penguins Dataset!

To make a nice graph of the Palmer Penguins dataset, lets follow these steps:
1. Import helpful packages
2. Read in the dataset
3. Decide what kind of graph/plot would work best with the variables you want to look at
4. Render the data

### 1. Load in the Palmer Penguins Dataset

First, let's import all the packages that will help us create a nice graph of the data.
Matplotlib and pandas will be helpful for rendering the graphs and also creating nice tables that allow us to look at our data in an organized manner.

```
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
### 2. Read in the dataset

To do this, we will use the pandas `read_csv()` function with the link to our dataset passed in.

```
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Let's also call the variable we want to store the data "penguins". Use `penguins.head()` to look at the first few rows of data.

### 3. Decide which graph/plot to use

Here, we will decide which variables we want to visualize. I want to visualize the penguin `Culmen Length (mm)` and `Flipper Length (mm)` and compare those metrics between each penguin `Species`.  

Since we have two quantitative variables `Culmen Length (mm)` and `Culmen Depth (mm)`, let's make a scatterplot where penguins of different species are represented with different colored dots.

### 4. Render the data

Lets create a figure and set the axes labels to Culmen Length on the x-axis and Flipper Length on the y-axis. We'll also make the fig size so that it is nice and large and easy to see:

```
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize = (10,10))
ax.set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)", ylabel = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

Now lets iterate through each unique species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) and plot their respective Culmen Lengths and Flipper Lengths where the label will be set to the appropriate Species and alpha indicates the opacity of the dots:

```
for i in penguins['Species'].unique():
    speciesgrp = penguins[penguins['Species'] == i]
    speciesgrp.notnull()

    ax.scatter(speciesgrp['Culmen Length (mm)'], speciesgrp["Flipper Length (mm)"], label = i, alpha = 0.5)
```

Finally, we'll add a legend:

```
ax.legend()
```

And voila! There you have it! A graph comparing the Culmen Lengths and Flipper Lengths of each species of penguins.
