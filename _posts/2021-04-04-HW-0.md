## Let's Construct a Visualization of the Palmer Penguins Dataset

To make a nice graph of the Palmer Penguins dataset, lets follow these steps:
1. Import helpful packages
2. Read in the dataset
3. Clean the dataset
4. Decide what kind of graph/plot would work best with the variables you want to look at
5. Render the data

### 1. Load in the Palmer Penguins Dataset

First, let's import all the packages that will help us create a nice graph of the data.
Matplotlib and pandas will be helpful for rendering the graphs and also creating nice tables that allow us to look at our data in an organized manner.

```
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
### 2. Read in the dataset

To do this, we will use the pandas `read_csv()` function with the link to our dataset passed in.

```
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Let's also call the variable we want to store the data "penguins". Use `penguins.head()` to look at the first few rows of data.

### 3. Clean the dataset

Here, we will decide which variables we want to visualize. I want to visualize the penguin Culmen Length (mm) and Flipper Length (mm) and look at the differences of those metrics on each Island (Biscoe, Dream, Torgeson). 

**Hint**: Most website options are controlled by the file `_config.yml`:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

### Modifying Appearance

There are many ways to modify the appearance of your website. If you are comfortable with `css`, then you can directly modify `style.scss` and other files in the repo. If you want to get fancier, you can look into migrating to one of the many available themes in the [Jekyll theme gallery](https://jekyllthemes.io/free). Please note that, while theming your website can be fun and satisfying, it is outside the scope of the course. As a consequence, neither I nor the TA can help you troubleshoot your website if you are using a theme. Proceed at your own risk!

## ยง2. Create a post!

Create a simple blog post, using the instructions and demonstrations [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/composing). Here is the prompt for your post:

> Write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data set.

You can read the data into Python by running:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = read_csv(url)
```
Your visualization does not have to be complex or fancy, but it should be highly readable and appropriately labeled. Here are the requirements for your post:

1. Your post should have lots of **explanatory text.** Your goal is to explain to someone how to create the visualization! Make sure to explain the usage of tools from `pandas` or `matplotlib`, for example.
2. Your post should include **all the code needed** to construct the visualization. Show us everything!
3. Your post should include the image directly under the code that generates it, as demonstrated [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/composing) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/example-post).
4. Your post should include the use of the `got-help` and `gave-help` environments demonstrated [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/composing) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/example-post). Feel free to put some filler text within these environments, since you won't be giving or receiving peer feedback on this assignment.

Commit and push your post to publish it to the web. Your assignment is not complete until it is a live blog post on the internet!

On CCLE, submit a link to your published post.

#### Hint

The easiest way to create a post like this is to solve the problem in a Jupyter Notebook *first*, and then transfer the results over to your blog.
