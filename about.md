Nice to meet you, I'm Kendall!

### About me

I am an explorer, innovator, and a creator. As an undergraduate student at UCLA, I am majoring in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing and a minor in Spanish.
​
Aside from school, I love to explore–whether it be in different countries, within my own community, or in my home. From backpacking to skiing, from photography and graphic design, to drawing and jewelry making, I believe that people can best learn about themselves and their place in this world by looking at what's around them.
